;;; NAME:	 find-error.el
;;; SYNOPSIS:	 A GNU Emacs extension which finds an error in an emacs
;;;		 library file and positions point there.
;;; VERSION:	 1.0
;;; LAST CHANGE: Can't remember.
;;; CREATED:	 Ages ago...
;;; AUTHOR:	 Mikael Djurfeldt <djurfeldt@nada.kth.se>

;;;
;;; USAGE:
;;;  Issue the `find-error' command in a buffer containing erroneous
;;;  emacs lisp code.
;;;
;;; BUGS:
;;;  The code in the buffer is evaluated several times.  This should
;;;  not be any problem since emacs libraries *should* be written
;;;  so that they can be evaluated many times.
;;;
